# barn-scrape
A set of scrapers that help me to obtain data from the web.

I sometimes write scripts in order to retrieve various data from the web.
I put them into this repository in order to keep track of the scripts.


## Prerequisites
Each script may have its own requisites. Look into the scripts in order to learn what you need.

Generally, the scripts run on `Unix` operating systems and consist of `Python` code. The scripts
mainly use the libraries `requests` (http://python-requests.org), `beautifulsoup`
(https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup), `lxml` (https://lxml.de/) and the `Python` standard
library.


## Usage
Consult the individual scripts in order to learn about their usage.
You may call them via commandline.


## Contributing
Work on your stuff locally, branch, commit and modify to your heart's content.
If there is anything you can extend, fix or improve, please do so!
Happy coding!
